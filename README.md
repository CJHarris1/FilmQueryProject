# Film Query Project

## Description
This week at Skill Distillery boot camp our project was to create a movie search application. The application allows a user to search for specific movies based on a unique film id or a keyword in the title or description. Upon starting the program you will be prompted with a menu to search using film id, to search with a keyword, or to exit the program. Each search selection will allow you to type in your search criteria and allow you to keep searching, or go back to main menu to reselect.

## What I learned
This was our first week learning how to query a database and to apply that knowledge into our java classes. We learned how to make a connection to the database, use prepared statements to safely query the database without risk of sql injection, and print out the information we wanted with our results set. On top of this newly learned knowledge I paired it with my java experience to create a fully operational command line application that can effectively search the database and return the correct information the user was looking for while maintaining proper object oriented programming principles including encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, and abstraction.
